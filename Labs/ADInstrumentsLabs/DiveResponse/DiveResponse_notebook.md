## Dive Response Notebook
You may work LabChart and data analysis as part of your group, but your analysis and answers to the questions below should be your own work and in your own words.

#  Data Notebook

#### Table 1. Changes during the Dive Response

|                        | **Heart Rate (BPM)** | **Pulse Amplitude** |
|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Rest**               |                      |                     |
| **15 Seconds into the Dive** |              |                     |
| **End of the Dive**    |                      |                     |
| **30 Seconds after Dive** |                  |                     |

#### Table 2. Changes during Breath-holding

|                              | **Heart Rate (BPM)** | **Pulse Amplitude** |
|------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Rest**                     |                      |                     |
| **15 Seconds into Breath-hold** |                  |                     |
| **End of Breath-hold**       |                      |                     |
| **30 Seconds after Breath-hold** |                |                     |

#### Table 3. Changes in Peripheral Circulation
|                 | **Change in Leg Blood Volume** |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Rest**        |                                |
| **Dive**        |                                |
| **Breath-hold** |                                |

# Followup Questions

1.  Describe any change in heart rate and pulse amplitude observed during and after the simulated dive.
1.  Compare your results of heart rate during the dive and breath-holding. Are they the same? Explain your results.
1.  What environmental factors could explain differences between breath-holding and a dive?
1.  Do your results for leg blood volume suggest that peripheral circulation changes during a breath-hold?
1.  Did peripheral circulation increase or decrease during a dive? Explain your results.
2.  Based on your data, describe the potential advantages and disadvantages of the dive response. What other factors should be accounted for during a real dive?
