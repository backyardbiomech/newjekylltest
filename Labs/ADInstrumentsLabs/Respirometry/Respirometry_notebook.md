## Follow up Questions
1.  Comment on the differences between the experimental and predicted values for VC, FRC, and TLC in Table 1. What could cause these differences, if any?
1. In quiet breathing, muscular effort is mainly in inspiration, and expiration is largely passive, due to elastic recoiling of the lung. Can you relate this fact to the pattern of expiratory and inspiratory flow? Hint: The normal pattern of breathing is efficient in that it requires muscular effort for only a short time.
1. Explain why RV cannot be determined by ordinary spirometry.**
2. What factors do you think could contribute to differences in pulmonary parameters between the members of your group?
1. What values were affected by simulated airway obstruction, and
why?
1. Explain the physiological events that occurred during the
simulated asthma attack. Hint: Think about what it felt like and how it would affect your general state of well-being and activity level.
