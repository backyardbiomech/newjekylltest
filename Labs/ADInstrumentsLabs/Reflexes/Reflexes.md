# Reflexes & Reaction Times

In this experiment, you will investigate your reflexes and reaction
times in response to a variety of stimuli and under a variety of
conditions. You will examine some simple and complex reflexes from a
volunteer and look at reaction times from a volunteer given harmless
visual and auditory cues.

# Background

### Reflexes

All living things must detect changes in the environment and react
appropriately. For us, this involves receptors that detect the change,
sensory neurons which send the information to the central nervous system
where it is processed, and motor neurons that send the information to
effectors, such as skeletal muscle, that produce a response appropriate
to the situation. If a motor response is initiated, it usually involves
a series of action potentials that cause muscle contraction and a
movement of one or more parts of the body. Reflexes are examples of this
simple type of stimulus-response reaction. For example, a tap on the
tendon under the kneecap produces the knee-jerk, or myotatic, reflex. A
simple spinal reflex like the myotatic reflex is produced via single
synapses between sensory axons and motor neurons. The essential central
circuitry for this reflex is confined to the spinal cord (Figure 1),
though information also passes to the brain.

*Figure 1. Myotatic Reflex*

The myotatic reflex employs only two neurons. Striking the patellar
ligament just below the patella stretches the quadriceps muscle. This
stimulates sensory receptors in the muscle that trigger an impulse in a
sensory axon whose cell body lies in the dorsal root ganglion in the
lumbar region of the spinal cord. The sensory axon synapses directly
with a motor neuron that conducts the impulse to the quadriceps,
triggering contraction. In everyday life this reflex helps maintain the
upright posture.

Sensory information also ascends to higher centers, but the brain is not
necessary or required for many simple reflex functions.

![](media/image2.png){:width="236" height="236"}

More complex reflexes usually involve
additional cells, such as interneurons and more than one population of
motor neurons. This results in a longer delay between stimulus reception
and the more complex response. One example of this is the pupillary, or
direct light, reflex, which involves four neurons that connect the
retina to the midbrain and then convey information back to the ciliary
muscle. When light is focused upon the eye, the pupillary sphincter
muscle in the iris constricts reducing the diameter of the pupil. At the
same time, the pupillary sphincter muscle of the other eye constricts
too, causing the consensual light reflex (Figure 2). This pupillary
constriction is known as miosis (from Greek meiosis = diminution),
pupillary dilatation is called mydriasis.

*Figure 2. Pupillary Reflex*

The flexion withdrawal reflex (Figure 3) mediates the withdrawal of a
limb from a painful stimulus and is not studied in human volunteers for
obvious reasons. However, a little-known reflex exists involving an
obscure muscle in the hand - the palmaris brevis muscle - that shares
some features of the flexion reflex. Like the other reflex pathways,
local circuit neurons in the flexion reflex pathway receive converging
inputs from several different sources, including cutaneous receptors,
other spinal cord interneurons, and upper motor neuron pathways.

### Reaction Times

Voluntary reactions to a cue are considerably more complicated than
reflexes. They require higher brain functions, rather than relying on
low-level neuronal circuitry. During a voluntary reaction, such as
swinging a bat at a thrown ball, a signal from your eyes sends a message
to a part of your brain that controls your muscles. Your brain must then
send a signal to your muscles, telling them to swing. Although it takes
some time for the signal to travel along each nerve, the major delay in
your reaction time occurs at the synapses between the different neurons
involved.

While reaction times vary, the generally accepted figures for mean
simple reaction times for college-age individuals are about 190 ms for
light stimuli and about 150 ms for sound stimuli. Reaction time to touch
is about 155 ms. Generally, an auditory stimulus only takes 8-10 ms to
reach the brain but a visual stimulus takes 20-40 ms.

Many different factors can affect an individual's reaction time. The
following table lists some of the factors to take into consideration:

| **Factor**  | **Effect** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Age         | **±**      | For both males and females, reaction time shortens from infancy into late 20s, then increases slowly until the 50s and 60s, and then lengthens faster as the person gets into his 70s and beyond. |
| Arousal     | **±**      | Reaction time is fastest with an intermediate level of arousal, and deteriorates when the subject is either too relaxed or too tense.                                                             |
| Distraction | **+**      | Distractions increase reaction time significantly, especially in younger individuals.                                                                                                             |
| Gender      | **±**      | Males generally have faster reaction times than females.                                                                                                                                          |
| Practice    | **-**      | Practice at a task decreases reaction time.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Errors      | **+**      | When a volunteer makes an error (like pressing the button before the stimulus is presented), subsequent reaction times are slower likely due to the subject being more cautious.                  |
| Fatigue     | **+**      | Reaction time deterioration due to fatigue is more marked when the task is complicated than when it is simple. Mental fatigue, especially sleepiness, has the greatest effect.                    |
| Punishment  | **-**      | Shocking a subject when he reacts slowly does shorten reaction time (we will not replicate these experiment for obvious reasons).                                                                 |
| Drugs       | **±**      | Stimulants tend to decrease reaction times to a point, but see arousal above. Depressants often increase reaction times.                                                                          |
| Warnings    | **-**      | Generally, reaction times are faster when the subject has been warned that a stimulus will arrive soon.                                                                                           |

# Required Equipment

-   LabChart software

-   PowerLab Data Acquisition Unit

-   Goniometer

-   Tendon Hammer

-   Push Button Switch

-   Finger Pulse Transducer

-   Small flashlight

-   Medical tape

# Procedure

# Section 1: Reflexes

### Exercise 1: The Myotatic Reflex

In this exercise, you will observe the myotatic reflex in a relaxed
volunteer by stimulating the patellar tendon and will observe the
effects of other activity on the reflex.

1.  Make sure the PowerLab is turned **off** and the USB cable is
    connected to the computer.

2.  Connect the Tendon Hammer to Input 1 and the Goniometer (Joint Angle
    Sensor) to Input 2 on the front panel of the PowerLab. The hardware
    needs to be connected before you open the settings file.

3.  Attach the Goniometer to the volunteer's leg so that is the centered
    on the knee joint and adjust the straps so they are comfortably
    snug. Make sure the volunteer has a bare leg around the knee (Figure
    4).

4.  Turn on the PowerLab.

![](media/image4.png){:width="232" height="181"}



*Figure 4. Goniometer Setup*

5.  Launch LabChart and open the settings file "Knee Jerk Settings" from
    the **Experiments** tab in the **Welcome Center**. It will be
    located in the folder for this experiment.

6.  Have the volunteer sit in a relaxed position and cross the leg that
    has the Goniometer attached over the other leg. Make sure his/her
    foot is free to swing backward and forward.

7.  With the Tendon Hammer, tap the patellar tendon just below the knee
    to elicit the myotatic, or knee jerk, response. Practice this
    exercise a few times so that you are comfortable in getting a
    reliable response.

8.  **Start** recording. Using the Tendon Hammer, tap the patellar
    tendon of the volunteer. Repeat this four more times, so that you
    have five blocks of data.

9.  Now have the volunteer perform the Jendrassik maneuver. To do this,
    have the volunteer cup and link the fingers of both hands, and then
    strongly pull outwards across the chest. While the volunteer
    performs the maneuver, use the Tendon Hammer to tap the patellar
    tendon. Add a **comment** with "Jendrassik" when you tap the tendon.
    Record a total of five responses.

10. **Save your data** when you are finished recording.

# Analysis

### Exercise 1: The Myotatic Reflex

1.  Examine the data in the Chart View. **Autoscale**, if necessary. You
    will analyze and compare the latency and change in leg angle under
    normal conditions and while performing the Jendrassik maneuver.

2.  Scroll to the first block of data performed under normal conditions.
    Use the **Waveform Cursor** to measure the time between the stimulus
    and the start of the muscle contraction (the latency). Move the
    cursor to the point where the Goniometer trace starts to deflect.
    Record the latency in Table 1 of the Data Notebook under the heading
    "Latency" on page 13 of this document

3.  Measure the amplitude of the knee jerk response for the same data by
    placing the **Marker** on the baseline data in the Angle channel and
    the **Waveform Cursor** on the peak of the waveform. You must return
    the Marker to its dock before proceeding to the next block. Record
    the angle in Table 1 of the Data Notebook under the heading "Angle"
    on page 13.

4.  Repeat this procedure for all of the data blocks completed in the
    exercise.

### Exercise 2: The Pupillary Reflex

In this exercise, you will examine the pupillary reflex and related
effects in the volunteer. The PowerLab and LabChart are not needed for
this exercise.

1.  Shade the volunteer's eyes for about 15 seconds.

2.  Shine a light into one eye, and record the response of that eye in
    > the Data Notebook.

3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2, but record the response of the pupil in the
    > unstimulated eye in the Data Notebook.

4.  With normal lighting, have the volunteer look into the distance and
    > then at an object held about 10 cm from the eye. You will record
    > what happens to the pupils in the Data Notebook.

# Analysis

### Exercise 2: The Pupillary Reflex

1.  Record your observations from Exercise 2 in the Data Notebook on
    pages 13 of this document.

### Exercise 3: Reflex Contraction of the Palmaris Brevis Muscle

In this exercise, you will examine the reflex contraction of the
palmaris brevis muscle in the hand. The PowerLab and LabChart are not
needed for this exercise. Everyone in the group can complete this
exercise simultaneously.

1.  Cup your hand, as though for drinking water. Note the dimpling of
    the skin along the ulnar border (Figure 5). This dimpling is the
    action of the palmaris brevis muscle.

    ***Note:** In some people, it is difficult to see the dimpling of
    the skin. Reflex effects will then be hard to demonstrate.*

![](media/image5.png){:width="363" height="190"}

*Figure 5. Palmaris Brevis Muscle*

11. With the palm of your hand facing up and the hand relaxed, press
    your fingernail over the pisiform bone (Figure 5). Firm pressure
    causes a reflex contraction of the palmaris brevis muscle.

12. Now try to find other bony prominences in the hand at which the
    reflex can be elicited.

13. Attempt to contract the palmaris brevis muscle voluntarily, without
    moving your little finger. Most people find this difficult or
    impossible. However, with extensive practice, the movement can be
    learned.

14. You will record all your observations in the Data Notebook.

# Analysis

### Exercise 3: Reflex Contraction of the Palmaris Brevis Muscle

1.  Record your observations from Exercise 3 in the Data Notebook on
    page 14 of this document.

# Section 2: Reaction Times

### Exercise 4: Reaction Time to a Visual Cue

In this exercise, you will measure the volunteer's reaction time to a
visual cue.

1.  Disconnect the Tendon Hammer and Goniometer from the PowerLab.

2.  Connect the Push Button Switch to Input 1 and the Finger Pulse
    Transducer to Input 2 on the front panel of the PowerLab (Figure 6).
    The hardware needs to be connected **before** you open the settings
    file.

![](media/image6.png){:width="309" height="263"}

*Figure 6. Equipment Setup for PowerLab
26T*

3.  Wrap the Velcro strap around the Finger Pulse Transducer to cover
    its diaphragm. This protects the transducer from hard tapping.

4.  Place the Finger Pulse Transducer on the laboratory bench with the
    diaphragm facing up. Make sure it is in a place where it will not be
    bumped accidentally. Keep the transducer in place with a piece of
    medical tape across the cable.

5.  Click the "Home" button on the lower left corner of the screen. Open
    the settings file "Reaction Time Settings" from the **Experiments**
    tab in the **Welcome Center**. It will be located in the folder for
    this experiment. Make sure your data from Exercise 1 is saved.

6.  Instruct the volunteer to click the Push Button Switch as soon as
    he/she sees you tap the Finger Pulse Transducer. Hold your hand over
    the transducer, but do not touch it.

7.  **Start** recording.

***Note:** The system will record for 0.75 s when it receives a signal
from the Finger Pulse Transducer. This should be long enough for the
volunteer to respond by pressing the Push Button Switch. Recording will
stop automatically after ten data blocks are recorded.*

8.  After a delay of 1-4 s, tap the Finger Pulse Transducer without
    warning the volunteer. Repeat this step a total of 10 times. Make
    sure the taps are given without warning and at unpredictable
    intervals in the range of 1-4 s.

9.  Right click in Channel 1 and select **Add Comment** from the pop up
    menu. Enter the comment "exercise 4" and **Add** the comment. Save
    your data, but do not close the file.

# Analysis

### Exercise 4: Reaction Time to a Visual Cue

1.  ![](media/image7.png){:width="533"     height="255"}

Use **Scope View** to examine the
    data. Note that in Scope View each block of data is one page (Figure
    7). **Autoscale**, if necessary.

    *Figure 7. Reaction Time to a Visual Cue in Scope View*

2.  Select page 1, the first block of data for Exercise 4. Move the
    **Overlay Pages Slider** to the right to overlay the 10 blocks
    (pages) of data from this exercise (Figure 7). Note that there is
    some variability in the volunteer's reaction time.

3.  Move the **Waveform Cursor** until it is over the start of the
    response. The time is shown above and to the right of the trace.
    This is the reaction time. Record the reaction time in Table 2 of
    the Data Notebook under the heading "Visual Cue" on page 15 of this
    document.

4.  Select Page 2 and repeat step 3 to measure reaction time.

5.  Repeat this procedure for all of the data blocks completed in the
    exercise.

6.  Find the mean and standard deviation of the reaction time by
    deleting the longest and shortest values (and using the remaining
    eight values). Enter the mean and standard deviation in Table 2 at
    the bottom of the "Visual Cue" column on page 14.

### Exercise 5: Reaction Time with a Warning

In this exercise, you will measure the volunteer's reaction time to a
visual cue given immediately after a verbal prompt.

1.  **Start** recording. The system will begin recording when it
    receives a signal from the Finger Pulse Transducer.

2.  After a delay of 1-4 s, warn the volunteer verbally by saying
    "ready" immediately before tapping the transducer. The volunteer is
    to click the Push Button Switch as before. Repeat this for a total
    of 10 times. Make sure the taps are at unpredictable intervals in
    the range of 1-4 s. Recording will stop automatically after the 10
    data blocks have been recorded.

3.  Right click in Channel 1 and select **Add Comment** from the pop up
    menu. Enter the comment "exercise 5" and **Add** the comment. Save
    your data, but do not close the file.

    the bottom of the "With Warning" column on page 15.

### Exercise 6: Reaction Time to Predictable Cues

In this exercise, you will measure the volunteer's reaction time to a
cue given at regular intervals.

1.  **Start** recording. The system will begin recording when it
    receives a signal from the Finger Pulse Transducer.

2.  Instead of a verbal warning, tap the Finger Pulse Transducer in a
    regular rhythm, such as every two seconds. The volunteer is to click
    the Push Button Switch as before. Repeat this for a total of 10
    times. The LabChart software will record in the same manner as
    Exercise 4 and Exercise 5.

3.  Right click in Channel 1 and select **Add Comment** from the pop up
    menu. Enter the comment "exercise 6" and **Add** the comment. Save

### Exercise 7: Reaction Time with a Distracting Task

In this exercise, you will measure the volunteer's reaction time while
they are doing mental math.

1.  **Start** recording. The system will begin recording when it
    receives a signal from the Finger Pulse Transducer.

2.  Ask the volunteer to count down from 100 by 7s repeatedly as fast as
    possible. The volunteer should say each number aloud. For example,
    the volunteer will say 100, 93, 86, etc.

3.  After a delay of 1-4 s, tap the Finger Pulse Transducer without
    warning the volunteer. The volunteer is to click the Push Button
    Switch as before. Repeat this step a total of 10 times. Make sure
    the taps are given without warning and at unpredictable intervals in
    the range of 1-4 s. The LabChart software will record in the same

### Exercise 8: Reaction Time to an Auditory Cue

In this exercise, you will measure the volunteer's reaction time to a
sound.

1.  Have the volunteer face away from the monitor and Finger Pulse
    Transducer to avoid visual cues. Make sure they are close enough to
    hear you tapping on the transducer. You want to tap on the
    transducer so a sound can be heard clearly, but you do not want to
    damage the transducer. Practice a couple times to make sure your
    method is heard by the volunteer.

2.  **Start** recording. The system will begin recording when it
    receives a signal from the Finger Pulse Transducer.

### Exercise 2 Observations

a.  What is the response of the pupil when light is shone on it?

b.  What was the response of the pupil on the opposite eye?

c.  What happens to pupil diameter when the eye is focused for near
    vision?

### Exercise 3 Observations

a)  Were you able to elicit the flexion reflex pushing the pisiform bone
    in either hand?

b)  Were you able to find any other bony prominences in the hand at
    which the reflex could be elicited? Were you able to contract the
    palmaris brevis muscle voluntarily?

#  Study Questions

1.  **What effect does the Jendrassik maneuver have on the myotatic
    reflex?**

2.  **Based on your observations in Exercise 2, what happens to the
    pupil in each of the conditions tested?**

3.  **Based on your data, are the means and standard deviations for
    reaction time the same under all conditions? Why do you think this
    is?**

4.  **\
    Do you think the difference in reaction time between auditory and
    visual cues is due to different processing times in the brain? Ask
    the volunteer(s) who completed these exercises for their thoughts.**

5.  **Ask the volunteer who completed Exercise 6 whether or not it was
    easier to complete the task when the cues were predictable. Do your
    results from this exercise support their statement?**

6.  **Could the difference in reaction time between the exercises only
    be due to inherent variability in the experimental method?**
